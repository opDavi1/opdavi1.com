    <p>this website serves as my "home base" of sorts. I'll put images I find cool in the gallery, my pgp key lives here, my projects live here, etc.</p>
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Too much of the internet today (time of writing: October 2025) is reliant on a few giant entities such as aws and cloudflare, and for less tech-savvy people they are too reliant on social medias such as instagram, twitter, facebook, etc. We need to return to the days of making your website your home, and owning your website fully. If AWS were to shut down forever tomorrow, this website wouldn't even be down for a second.</p>
